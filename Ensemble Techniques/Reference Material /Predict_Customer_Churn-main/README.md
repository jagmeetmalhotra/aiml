Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
Introduction

Customer Churn/Attrition is the loss of clients, which is defined as the propensity of a customer to stop doing business with an organization in a given time period.

Telecom industires (Telephone/Internet service providers) often use customer churn analysis and customer churn rate as one of their key business metrics, because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquring a new one. Therefore, it's important to know churning customers beforehand.

Predictive analytics use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.
